_I'm on a quest to save the world, one database at a time!_

## Hi there, I'm Richard<a href="https://www.rkkoranteng.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"></a>

<strong>I'm a Senior Database Engineer, Consultant, and DBA Advocate.</strong>

I am a Senior Database Engineer, Consultant, and DBA Advocate, with a passion for modernizing database environments. I spend my time creating solutions to automate database lifecycle. As a Database Administration Advocate, I take immense joy in sharing my expertise with fellow DBA's and empowering them with the tools, resources, and support needed to deliver exceptional database experience. I spend my free time doing dad stuff & honey-do list 😏.
